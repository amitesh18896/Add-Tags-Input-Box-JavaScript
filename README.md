# Add-Tags-Input-Box-JavaScript

A tags input is a user interface (UI) component that allows


the user to add or insert multiple entries as tags into an input field.



In this project (Tags Input in JavaScript), as you can see on the 


webpage, there is an input box with some tags, button, and tags counter.


You can remove each tag by clicking on a close icon or remove all tags at once by clicking


on the Remove All button. You can insert a maximum of 10 tags


only and duplicate tags wonâ€™t be added in the input field.
